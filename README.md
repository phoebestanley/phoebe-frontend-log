# 🧾 Frontend Monthly Work Log (Brag List)

Welcome to my Front-End Developer journey 👩‍💻

This repository contains my **monthly progress logs** — also known as my *Brag List*. Each month, I document what I’ve learned, built, and achieved as a front-end student. This helps me track growth, stay accountable, and share my journey with others.

## 📅 Monthly Logs

- [July 2025](./2025/July.md) — Git, GitHub, JavaScript Basics
- [August 2025](./2025/August.md) — UI/UX Design, HTML, CSS, Advanced JavaScript

## 🌟 Why I'm Doing This

I'm learning in public to:
- Stay consistent and motivated
- Reflect on my learning process
- Build a portfolio of skills and experiences
- Connect with other developers and mentors
